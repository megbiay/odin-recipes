            <h2>Procedure</h2>
                <h3>For the Custard Filling:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a saucepan: combine the milk and 1/2 cup cream and heat on medium-high, whisking occassionally. Bring to a boil and immediately turn off heat. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>In a bow: whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Add the egg yolks. Whisk until pale yellow and smooth. While whisking, slowly pour in 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan.</li>
                        <li>Cook the mixture over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and just starting to bubble. Remove from the ehat and whisk in the butter until fully melted and combined. Transfer the custard into a large bowl.</li>
                        <li>Cover with plasting wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent skin from forming. Chill for at least 2 hours. Can be made up to 2 days in advance.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>For the Choux Pastry:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 425F. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
                        <li>In a saucepan: combine water, butter, sugar, salt and heat to boil on medium-high heat. Remove from heat immediately upon boiling.</li>
                        <li>Add all of the flour at once, stir with a wodden spoon until all the flour is incorporated. Return to medium heat and cook, stirring for about 60 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Transfer then mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat at medium speed for about 2 minutes until it cools (but still warm).</li>
                        <li>With the mixer running, add 3 eggs one at a time, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl upon the addition of each egg. Mix until dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick but fall slowly and steadily from the beater when lifted out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beater, add the remaining 1 egg and mix until incorporated.</li>
                        <li>Transfer dough to a pastry bag. Pipe dollops roughly 2 inches in diameter and 1 inch high. Lightly wet a finger and tap down the spike on top. (Optional: For more colow, brush the tops of the dough lightly with an egg wash.)</li>
                        <li>Bake for about 20 minutes, until the dough is golden brown and appears dry. (Do not open the oven door during baking.) Turn the oven off, leave the puffs in the oven with the door cracked open. This will prevent the cream puff from deflating by letting the choux pastry cool down gradually.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>Assembly:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>With a bread knife, pierce a hole on one side of each choux pastry.</li>
                        <li>Put the custard in a piping bag with a piping tip.</li>
                        <li>Insert the tip of the piping  to the choux pastry, then fill with custard.</li>
                    </ol>
