            <h2>Description</h2>
            A homemade version of the popular Japanese treat, <em>Tokyo Milk Cheese Cookies</em>. 
            <br>
            Made with Gouda cheese, which is a more accessible variation of cheese. Cookies are made with 4 ingredients, the milk flavor coming from condensed milk. The sweetness from the condensed milk isn't too intense, which deepens the cheese flavor.
